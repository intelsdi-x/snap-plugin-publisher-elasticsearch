## Getting Started

### System Requirements

* [golang 1.6+](https://golang.org/dl/)  (needed only for building)
* Elasticsearch instance to publish data (docker run elasticsearch)

### Installation

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-publisher-elasticsearch  
Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/`:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-publisher-elasticsearch.git
```

Build the plugin by running make within the cloned repo:
```
$ make
```

This builds the plugin in `./build/`

### Configuration and Usage

* Set up the [Snap framework](https://github.com/intesdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)

## Documentation

The plugin expects you to provide following parameters:
 - `protocol` http, https, tls
 - `address` address of elasticsearch endpoint
 - `port` elasticsearch port
 - `index` index for publishing data
 - `type` mapping type

You can also set following options if needed:
 - `index_timestamp` default is set to `true` (boolean). Set to false if not want to extend index prefix with timestamp
 - `publish_fields` default is set to `Namespace|Config|Data|Description|Timestamp|Unit|Version` (string). Remove field from metric structure which shouldn't be published.

Plugin publishes dynamic elements from metric namespace.

### Examples

You can find exemplary task manifests for using this plugin in folder [examples](examples/tasks).

Example running [logs collector plugin](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-logs), [logs-regexp processor](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-processor-logs-regexp),
[logs-openstack processor](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-processor-logs-openstack), and writing data to elasticsearch.

Prepare docker with elasticsearch
```
$ docker pull elasticsearch
$ docker run --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 elasticsearch
```

In one terminal window, open the Snap daemon:
```
$ snapteld -t 0 -l 1 -m 999
```

The option "-l 1" it is for setting the debugging log level, "-t 0" is for disabling plugin signing, and "-m 999" is for the maximum number of instances of a loaded plugin to run.

In another terminal window:

Download and load collector, processor and publisher plugins:
```
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-collector-logs/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-collector-logs
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-processor-logs-regexp/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-processor-logs-regexp
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-processor-logs-openstack/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-processor-logs-openstack
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-publisher-elasticsearch/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-publisher-elasticsearch
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-collector-logs
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-processor-logs-regexp
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-processor-logs-openstack
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-publisher-elasticsearch
```

Find logs to collect or use exemplary logs available in [logs](examples/logs).

Create task manifests, see examples:
- to use snap-plugin-collector-logs, snap-plugin-processor-logs-regexp, snap-plugin-publisher-elasticsearch - [logs-regexp-elasticsearch.json](examples/tasks/logs-regexp-elasticsearch.json)
- to use snap-plugin-collector-logs, snap-plugin-processor-logs-openstack, snap-plugin-publisher-elasticsearch - [logs-openstack-elasticsearch.json](examples/tasks/logs-openstack-elasticsearch.json)

If you are using exemplary logs you need to modify `"log_dir"` in task manifests and set appropriate paths to directories with logs.
If you want to collect your own logs you need to adjust config sections in task manifests to your environment.

Create tasks:
```
$ snaptel task create -t logs-regexp-elasticsearch.json
$ snaptel task create -t logs-openstack-elasticsearch.json
```

See running tasks:
```
$ snaptel task list
```

Check indexes in elasticsearch:
```
$ curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'
```

See data saved in elasticsearch:
```
$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/snap*/message/_search?pretty=true&size=9999'
```

Exemplary data saved in elasticsearch has the form which is shown in [outputs](examples/outputs).
